Hi! I am Toshit Jain, a Computer Science Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology
Guwahati (IIT, Guwahati), Guwahati, India. I am interested in problem solving, mathematics and 
competitive programming. Except for technical stuff, I enjoy playing 
guitar. I am open to any opportunity for Winter 2025 & Summer 2026. 
Feel free to approach me through the emails given.

## Techinical Interests

- **Competitive Programming :** Coming up with efficient algorithms and accurate implementations
is always fun. I love giving contests and participating with my team in nation wide competitions.
I also have a keen interest in C++ and low level programming!

- **Problem Solving & Mathematics :** I love to solve all kind of mathematical problems
especially non-routine. I really like to solve puzzles during my free time.

- **Machine Learning :** I have a decent interesnt in Machine Learning and AI as well
and have done a decent amount of implementation in some basic projects, like implementing
UNets and ResNets or using PaddleOCR(only application).

## Non Technical Interests

I like to learn & play fingerstyle technique on acoustic guitar. I also love listening to
pop music and some Japanese music as well. I like to play table tennis as a sport
(although I am not so good at it :p).
