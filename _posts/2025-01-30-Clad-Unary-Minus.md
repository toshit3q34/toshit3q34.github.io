# Simplifying Expression Trees with LLVM’s Clang AST API

In one of my recent open-source contributions, I enhanced the handling of expression trees in a Clang-based static analysis tool by simplifying redundant parentheses directly at the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) level.

Using **LLVM’s Clang AST API**, I traversed expression nodes to detect unnecessary parentheses introduced during parsing or code transformations. These often clutter the AST and make further analysis or transformations harder to perform. My PR implemented logic to safely restructure such expressions while preserving semantic correctness.

This optimization not only cleaned up the AST but also improved downstream tooling that relies on a cleaner expression structure, such as automatic differentiation passes and pretty-printers.

**Pull Request**: [#1180 – Fix for Parenthesis issue in gradients](https://github.com/vgvassilev/clad/pull/1180)

This contribution gave me hands-on experience with:
- LLVM/Clang’s AST data structures and visitors  
- Static code transformation and analysis  
- Working with large, modular open-source codebases  

I’m looking forward to continuing my work in compiler tooling, static analysis, and open-source development.
